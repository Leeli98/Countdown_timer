7-Day Countdown — Beginner-Friendly

Live Demo Link: https://leeli98.github.io/Countdown_timer/

A tiny, clean countdown timer built with HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript.
It’s perfect for a junior portfolio: small enough to read in minutes, but with just enough structure to show you understand DOM work, date math, and simple state updates.

Features：


1) Three modes (switch by editing one line in script.js)

	- duration: countdown from now for a fixed duration (e.g., 7 days) and auto-reset when it reaches 0
	
	- fixed: countdown to a specific date/time (e.g., 2025-11-01 00:00:00)
	
	- next-month-1st: always targets the 1st day of next month at 00:00
	
2) Readable UI with accessible text and large digits

3) No frameworks — easy to review in interviews and friendly to GitHub Pages
